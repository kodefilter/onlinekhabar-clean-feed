The news site has many other distracting sponser advertisements which can't be removed by Adblocker. 
Since almost all of these advertisements are gif animations it affects the reading experince for the reader.

Here, the code applies a CSS rule to hide all elements that have a class starting with okam-ad by setting their display property to "none".


Final result is advertisement free with a better reading experience.
