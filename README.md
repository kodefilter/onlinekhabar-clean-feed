Google Chrome Extension For Removing Local Ads Of onlineKhabar.com

The new site has many other distracting sponser advertisements which can't be removed by Adblocker. 
Since almost all of these advertisements are gif animations it affects the reading experince for the reader.

Here I have created very simple two line of code extension that selects elements that contains advertiments and sets
its visibility to "none"


Final result is advertisement free with a better reading experience.
